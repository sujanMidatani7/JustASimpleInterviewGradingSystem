# JustASimpleInterviewGradingSystem 

This README provides an overview of the Interview System, its functionalities, and the process it follows for conducting interviews and evaluating the performance of interviewees. The system incorporates various events such as resume summary extraction, resume-related question generation, text-to-speech for question presentation, speech-to-text for recording interviewee answers, and evaluation of answers. The system also stores evaluation results as CSV records and calculates the final performance of the interview based on multiple factors.

## Functionality

The Interview System is designed to streamline the interview process by automating several tasks. The main functionalities of the system are as follows:

1. **Resume Summary Extraction:** The system extracts a summary of the interviewee's resume to gather relevant information for the interview process.

2. **Resume Related Question Generation:** Based on the extracted resume summary, the system generates interview questions that are relevant to the interviewee's background and experience.

3. **Text-to-Speech Question Presentation:** The generated questions are displayed to the user and read out using text-to-speech technology, allowing the interviewee to hear the questions.

4. **Speech-to-Text Answer Recording:** The interviewee answers the questions using their voice, and the system converts their speech into text using speech-to-text technology. The recording of the answer is restricted to a maximum of 2 minutes.

5. **Answer Evaluation:** The system evaluates each answer individually based on predefined criteria. If the grade for a question is below the average grade, a follow-up question is generated and evaluated.

6. **CSV Record Storage:** The evaluations for each question, including the primary questions and follow-up questions, are stored in a list of CSV records for future reference and analysis.

7. **Final Performance Evaluation:** The final performance of the interviewee is calculated based on multiple factors, including the summary of their resume, the job role they applied for, their experience, and their performance in the interview. All these factors are considered in the evaluation process.
